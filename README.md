# Become a Software Professional 2023

In this repository I will work in all phases of development for a gym called MEGA ROCKET, which asked us to make their complete website.

In the first phase, which took place in the first week, we discussed with the whole team, designed and laid out the whole website using figma.

We will take care from the figma design to the full development of the functionalities, so we will also work on the backend of the project to make it work properly.

## Week 01


- We designed in figma a project for a gym called "MEGA ROCKET".
We had to work as a team of more than 10 people coordinating the different parts of the project. We were not allowed to style the page, we just had to make the whole structure with HTML.


## Week 02

- We must create a page using only HTML based on the previous week's figma. We also learned the basic commands of git and github, so we can upload our repositories and have a record, besides being able to locate the changes well and work as a team.

## Week 03

- In this new week we must style the HTML page we made working with CSS. We were instructed not to use flexbox so it must be in pixel perfect mode. We should use as reference a screen of 1512px wide. It cost me a lot to place each section in its place.

## Week 04

- This week we leave aside the idea of pixel perfect and we must make our page using flexbox, which is a novelty and helps us to save a lot of time, besides using much less lines. We must follow the mobile first model, besides designing for tablet and desktop.

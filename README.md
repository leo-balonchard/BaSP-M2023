# Become a Software Professional 2023

In this bootcamp I will work with a team in all phases of development for a real project. From the figma design to the backend for the correct functioning of the project. In the case of our team we had to make a comprehensive website for a gym which has several sections not only for members but also for admins and employees of the company.

## Week 01


- We designed in figma a project for a gym called "MEGA ROCKET". 
We had to work as a team of more than 10 people coordinating the different parts of the project. We were not allowed to style the page, we just had to make the whole structure with HTML.


## Week 02

- We must create a page using only HTML based on the previous week's figma. We also learned the basic commands of git and github, so we can upload our repositories and have a record, besides being able to locate the changes well and work as a team.

## Week 03

- In this new week we must style the HTML page we made working with CSS. We were instructed not to use flexbox so it must be in pixel perfect mode. We should use as reference a screen of 1512px wide. It cost me a lot to place each section in its place.

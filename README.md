# Become a Software Professional 2023

In this bootcamp I will work with a team in all phases of development for a real project. From the figma design to the backend for the correct functioning of the project.

## Week 01


- We designed in figma a project for a gym called "MEGA ROCKET". 
We had to work as a team of more than 10 people coordinating the different parts of the project.


## Week 02

- We must create a page using only HTML based on the previous week's figma. We must also use git and github.
